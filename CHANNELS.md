# Nostalgex Channel Guide

<!-- GENERATED FILE — do not edit by hand. Run `npm run channels:doc` after any
     channels.json change. Source: scripts/render-channels-doc.mjs -->

Quick reference for every channel and bundle. Source of truth: `channels.json`.

## Read this before editing a channel

**`id` and `number` are NOT the same thing.** A channel's `number` is what
viewers tune to; its `id` is the stable key everything else references. They
drifted apart as channels were renumbered, and today they differ for many
channels — for example `id` 40 is **CH85 TRUE CRIME**, and `id` 211 is
**CH140 CRITERION**. Get it wrong and you edit a different channel than the one
you meant.

Which key does what:

| Uses `id` | Uses `number` |
|---|---|
| `channels-memberships.json` (the TMDB membership manifest) | The on-screen channel number and guide ordering |
| `exclusiveRules.channelID` / `channelIDs` | Nothing else |
| `bundles[].channelIDs` | |
| Daily EPG manifest cache keys | |

Every table below shows both.

**Pool filter logic must stay aligned across three implementations.**
`scripts/nostalgex-channel-filter.cjs` (web tuner + devtools) mirrors
`Nostalgex/Nostalgex/App/AppState+Channels.swift` → `filterItems` (tvOS).
They do not share code, so a rule change has to land in both or the platforms
drift. TMDB membership manifest: `channels-memberships.json`.

**Schedule ordering must stay aligned too.**
`scripts/nostalgex-daily-manifest.js` mirrors
`Nostalgex/Nostalgex/Models/SchedulePoolOrdering.swift` and
`Nostalgex/Nostalgex/Services/DailyManifestScheduler.swift`, bit-for-bit, so
web and Apple TV air the same program at the same time.

**Keyword matches are ADDITIVE.** They broaden what a channel can pull in; they
never gate it. Never gate keywords on a broad genre like Drama — it leaks
unrelated titles. `keywordGatedGenres` is the deliberate exception, and it must
only name the channel's own defining genre.

**`rewatched` means `viewCount >= 3`** in both implementations.

**Config version:** 36 · **131 channels** across **14 bundles** · 81 channels whose `id` differs from their `number`.

## Channel exclusivity

Exclusive rules block a title from EVERY channel except the listed channel
`id`s. **Only lock a title to a channel when you are 95%+ sure it belongs
nowhere else — default to overlap.** Over-locking hides content: locking Die
Hard into the holiday channel made it vanish from action for eleven months of
the year.

| Locked to | Matches on | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CH130 HOLIDAZE (id 130)<br>CH131 SANTA'S LIST (id 409)<br>CH132 NAUGHTY LIST (id 410)<br>CH133 NOSTALGEX CHRISTMAS (id 411)<br>CH134 HALLMARK (id 412) | genres Holiday/Christmas, 19 title keywords, 49 editorial titles |  |
| id 32 (missing)<br>CH59 ANIME (id 60) | genres Anime, TMDB manifest claim (`manifestExclusive`) | Anime is claimed by genre `Anime` OR by a TMDB-manifest claim (`manifestExclusive`), so manifest-claimed anime is blocked from the other animation channels even when Plex only tags it "Animation". The manifest builder gates these channels with `requireGenres: ["Animation"]` + `requireOriginalLanguage: ["ja"]` + `autoSweepCollections: false` so TMDB similar/collection noise cannot be claimed — that blocks live-action (Spy Kids) AND Western animation (An American Tail, Avatar, Castlevania). Strict Japanese anime only. Re-run the keyword tuner to apply changes. |
| CH139 SCREAM ADULTS (id 132) | 2 title keywords, 8 editorial titles | Halloween horror is claimed by a title allowlist plus the manifest, so the seasonal channel owns it rather than the year-round horror channels. |
