-- Tighten RLS on media_enrichments (2026-09-10)
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor.
--
-- Context: rls-migration.sql enabled RLS but left INSERT/UPDATE as
-- `with check (true)` / `using (true)` — fully unrestricted. Since the
-- anon key is public (embedded in the app binary, and this repo is going
-- public too), anyone could insert junk rows or overwrite existing
-- enrichment data with garbage. This replaces those two policies with a
-- shared validity check matching the actual shape of data the app writes
-- (see Nostalgex/Nostalgex/Models/MediaEnrichment.swift). SELECT is left
-- as-is: it's public movie/TV metadata, no reason to restrict reads.

-- NOTE: this stops sloppy/automated spam and out-of-range garbage, but does
-- not stop a determined attacker who mimics valid-shaped data to overwrite
-- a specific title with plausible-but-wrong info. Accepted tradeoff for a
-- free hobby app with no PII/payment data — the real fix would be moving
-- writes behind a server-side Edge Function that validates against a live
-- TMDB/OMDb lookup before accepting.

-- Verify:
-- select polname, cmd, roles, qual, with_check from pg_policies where tablename = 'media_enrichments';
