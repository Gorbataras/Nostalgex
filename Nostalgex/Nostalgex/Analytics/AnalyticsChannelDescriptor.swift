/// Cross-user-comparable identity for a Channel that a signal is about.
///
/// Channel numbers alone can't be compared across users: bundles are opt-in and
/// dynamic collection channels are ordered per-user, so CH 74 on one Apple TV is
/// not the same lineup slot as CH 74 on another. Every signal that mentions a
/// channel therefore also carries this descriptor so the dashboard has a stable
/// grouping.
///
/// For **static** channels (defined in the app's own `channels.json`) we send:
/// - `channelType = "static"`
/// - `channelID`  = the fixed id from `channels.json` (1..223 today), same on
///   every device — this is what "which channel is watched most" filters on.
/// - `channelName` = the fixed display name from the app's **bundled**
///   `channels.json` for that id (e.g. `REWATCHABLES MOVIES`, `KIDZ CARTOONS`).
///   Deliberately NOT `Channel.name` at runtime — that could be overridden by
///   a server-hosted `channels.json` (`AppState.loadChannelConfig()` tries
///   `serverURL/channels.json` before the bundle), and analytics must never
///   carry a string the user's server could have influenced.
/// - `bundle`     = the channel's `category`, which is the bundle key
///   (`nostalgex`, `kids`, `truecrime`, `high-rotation`, ...).
///
/// For **dynamic collection** channels (built from a user's own Plex/Jellyfin/Emby
/// collections at runtime by `AppState.materializeCollectionChannels`) we send:
/// - `channelType = "collection"`
/// - no `channelID` (the per-install id would leak user ordering)
/// - **no `channelName`** — the runtime name is the user's own collection
///   title, which must never leave the device.
/// - `bundle`     = the collection category bundle key
///   (`collections-franchises`, `collections-actors`, `collections-custom`).
///
/// A grep for `channelType`, `channelID`, `channelName`, or `bundle` outside
/// this file / the event catalog should return nothing — the descriptor is
/// the only path.
